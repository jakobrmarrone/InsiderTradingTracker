# InsiderTradingTracker
The goal of this project is to create scape that refreshes the EDGAR SEC API continuously, looking for insider trades, scores the trades depending on who bought, how many, and at what price (etc). The scaper will then notify a user when a trade occurs and what its score is (strong buy, maybe, etc).
